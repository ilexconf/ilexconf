Building documentation
======================

Full documentation is available at **[ilexconf.com](https://ilexconf.com)** and on ilexconf.readthedocs.io.

* Documentation is written using `reStructuredText` and uses real code snippets from the unit tests and source code.
* Documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) using [sphinx-material](https://github.com/bashtage/sphinx-material) theme.
* Documentation is hosted on Github Pages at [ilexconf.com](https://ilexconf.com) and on "Read the Docs" at [ilexconf.readthedocs.io](https://ilexconf.readthedocs.io/).
* For Github Pages documentation is built using Github Actions.
* Read the Docs builds their version automatically based on the `.readthedocs.yml` config in the project root directory.
